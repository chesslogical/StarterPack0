0- Starting Rust from zero! 

1- Bash and Bat scripts to automate your repetitive tasks. I use this every day! You see, the Rust compiler might reject your code 20 times- it makes you do 20 updates and do the repetitive steps to compile it 20 times. The scripts here purge that barrier and annoyance from your life and help you focus on the code! I find ms windows 11 to be the far superior environment to dev rust apps. I keep a copy of r1 bat on the desktop, and option 1 instantly makes the rust framework dev area directory right on the desktop- it even copies itself (r1.bat) to the new directory. You will need to run cargo clean and then recompile countless hundreds of times a week, yes, the rust compiler is strict but it is worth it in the end when you have reliable memory safe apps! Even when making and app for linux, i usually start by coding it in windows with r1.bat 

2- Dealing with different graphical options while learning Rust
