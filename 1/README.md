Work smarter, not harder! Save time and key clicks! This can be edited to your taste. I actually use this script every day.

When compiling from windows, it saves time (and clicks and typing) just staying on the desktop. (c.bat)
/////
When compiling from Linux, it saves time (and clicks and typing) by compiling from this file!  (D.sh)

Update- r.bat is a bit more refined. For eample, place r.bat on your windows desktop. Run it. Hit option 1 to create a new rust project. For example, if you type game1 it will create a directory called game1 and populate it with the rust project files. ALSO, the batch file will copy itself into game1. In the previous ver, you had to cut and paste. Now that it is automatic, you just open game 1 folder on your desktop, edit the cargo.toml as needed and the main.rs file. Run the r.bat that was automatically copied to /game1.  Now you can compile or clean or all that. It greatly speeds up rust dev- makes your life easier.
