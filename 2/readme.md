Since all the graphical options depend on specific crates, it is not super helpful for learning Rust to make the same app in 10 different graphical styles. You are better off starting with very solid CLI apps where you just deal with the basics of Rust and not veer in to the graphical rabbit hole. If you make a CLI app that you really like, then you can give it different graphical interfaces. OR, you can take a simple CLI app and make 10 different graphical versions of it to see all the possibilities. Dealing with Graphics sharply veers away from dealing with the basics of learning rust tho, when starting out, stick to CLI apps.



When developing Rust applications on Windows, there are various types of applications you can create, each serving different purposes. Command Line Interface (CLI) applications are simple programs operated through a terminal or command prompt, often used for utilities and automation scripts. These applications typically rely on the std::io library for input/output and are easily packaged with Cargo. Console applications, similar to CLIs, might include more complex text-based user interfaces using libraries like crossterm or termion, suitable for interactive tools or server monitoring dashboards.

Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications in Rust utilize libraries such as Druid, Iced, or Gtk-rs to provide a more visually interactive experience, making them ideal for desktop software and multimedia applications. These applications involve managing windows, buttons, and other graphical elements, requiring more complex event handling and rendering.

For web applications, Rust supports both backend and frontend development. Backend web applications often use frameworks like Actix, Rocket, or Warp to build RESTful APIs or web services. These frameworks handle routing, middleware, and data format processing. On the frontend, Rust can be compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) using frameworks like Yew or Seed, enabling the creation of interactive web interfaces.

Rust also facilitates the development of libraries or crates, which are reusable components distributed via crates.io. These can be utilized across different application types, offering utility functions, data structures, or algorithms. For system-level programming and embedded systems, Rust provides a safe and efficient option, particularly with its no_std development for minimal runtime environments, making it suitable for operating system components and device drivers.

Additionally, Rust is gaining traction in game development with engines such as Amethyst and Bevy, allowing the creation of both 2D and 3D games. These environments require real-time rendering, physics, and audio handling, showcasing Rust's versatility across different development domains.
